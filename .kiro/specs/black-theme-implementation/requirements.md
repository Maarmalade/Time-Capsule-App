# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a black color theme for the Time Capsule Flutter application, specifically changing the primary accent color from blue to black throughout the design system. This change will provide a more sophisticated, elegant appearance while maintaining accessibility and usability standards. The implementation will focus on updating button colors, accent elements, and maintaining proper contrast ratios for optimal user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Black Primary Color Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to use black as the primary accent color instead of blue, so that I have a more sophisticated and elegant visual experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app displays primary buttons THEN the system SHALL use black (#000000) as the background color instead of blue
2. WHEN showing accent elements THEN the system SHALL use black (#000000) for highlights and call-to-action elements
3. WHEN displaying interactive states THEN the system SHALL use appropriate black color variations for hover, pressed, and focused states
4. WHEN showing primary color elements THEN the system SHALL ensure proper contrast ratios are maintained for accessibility
5. WHEN displaying the color scheme THEN the system SHALL use black as the primary accent while maintaining the existing neutral palette
6. WHEN rendering UI components THEN the system SHALL apply black theming consistently across all design system elements

### Requirement 2: Button Color System Update

**User Story:** As a user interacting with buttons throughout the app, I want all primary buttons to use black styling, so that I have a consistent and elegant interface experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying elevated buttons THEN the system SHALL use black background with white text for primary actions
2. WHEN showing outlined buttons THEN the system SHALL use black borders and black text on transparent backgrounds
3. WHEN displaying text buttons THEN the system SHALL use black text color for subtle actions
4. WHEN buttons are in hover state THEN the system SHALL use a slightly lighter black (#1A1A1A) for visual feedback
5. WHEN buttons are in pressed state THEN the system SHALL use a darker black (#0A0A0A) for interaction feedback
6. WHEN buttons are disabled THEN the system SHALL use black with reduced opacity (38%) for disabled state indication

### Requirement 3: Interactive Element Color Updates

**User Story:** As a user navigating the app, I want all interactive elements to use black theming, so that I have a cohesive visual experience across all features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying navigation elements THEN the system SHALL use black for active states and selection indicators
2. WHEN showing form inputs THEN the system SHALL use black for focus states and selection highlights
3. WHEN displaying checkboxes and radio buttons THEN the system SHALL use black for selected states
4. WHEN showing switches and toggles THEN the system SHALL use black for active/on states
5. WHEN displaying progress indicators THEN the system SHALL use black for progress bars and loading spinners
6. WHEN showing tabs and segmented controls THEN the system SHALL use black for active tab indicators

### Requirement 4: Accessibility and Contrast Compliance

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the black theme to maintain proper contrast ratios, so that I can use the app effectively regardless of my visual capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying black text on white backgrounds THEN the system SHALL maintain a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text
2. WHEN showing black backgrounds with white text THEN the system SHALL maintain a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for readability
3. WHEN displaying interactive elements THEN the system SHALL ensure focus indicators are clearly visible with sufficient contrast
4. WHEN showing disabled states THEN the system SHALL maintain minimum contrast requirements while indicating disabled status
5. WHEN displaying error or warning states THEN the system SHALL preserve semantic color meanings while integrating with black theme
6. WHEN rendering the interface THEN the system SHALL pass WCAG AA accessibility standards for color contrast

### Requirement 5: Semantic Color Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want semantic colors (success, warning, error) to work harmoniously with the black theme, so that I can understand system feedback while enjoying the elegant black aesthetic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying success states THEN the system SHALL use green (#28A745) that complements the black theme
2. WHEN showing warning states THEN the system SHALL use amber (#FFC107) that works well with black accents
3. WHEN displaying error states THEN the system SHALL use red (#DC3545) that maintains visibility with black elements
4. WHEN showing informational states THEN the system SHALL use a muted blue or gray that doesn't conflict with the black theme
5. WHEN combining semantic colors with black elements THEN the system SHALL ensure proper contrast and visual hierarchy
6. WHEN displaying status indicators THEN the system SHALL maintain color meaning while integrating with the black color scheme

### Requirement 6: Consistent Theme Application

**User Story:** As a user navigating different sections of the app, I want the black theme to be applied consistently everywhere, so that I have a unified visual experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any page in the app THEN the system SHALL apply black theming to all relevant UI elements
2. WHEN switching between features THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent black color usage across all screens
3. WHEN displaying dialogs and modals THEN the system SHALL use black theming for buttons and interactive elements
4. WHEN showing bottom sheets and overlays THEN the system SHALL apply black accent colors consistently
5. WHEN displaying cards and containers THEN the system SHALL use black for any accent elements or borders
6. WHEN rendering the entire app THEN the system SHALL ensure no blue accent colors remain visible in the interface
