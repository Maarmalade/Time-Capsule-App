# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical authentication issues preventing cloud functions from working, fixes the nostalgia reminder functionality that's not displaying favorited diary entries in the Digital Diary page, and resolves all existing errors across the application's pages, services, utils, and widgets to ensure a stable, error-free user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Authentication Setup for Cloud Functions

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to properly configure authentication for cloud functions so that Firebase operations work correctly during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is in development mode THEN App Check SHALL be disabled to prevent authentication errors
2. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN cloud functions SHALL receive proper authentication tokens
3. WHEN cloud functions are called THEN they SHALL not fail with "Authentication required" errors
4. IF App Check is causing "Too many attempts" errors THEN it SHALL be properly disabled for development
5. WHEN Firebase authentication is configured THEN it SHALL work seamlessly with cloud functions

### Requirement 2: Nostalgia Reminder Display Fix

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my favorited diary entries in the nostalgia reminder section of the Digital Diary page so that I can easily access my cherished memories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to the Digital Diary page THEN the nostalgia reminder section SHALL display favorited diary entries from the same date in previous years
2. WHEN I have favorited diary entries from the current date in past years THEN they SHALL appear in both the homepage throwback section and Digital Diary page nostalgia reminder
3. WHEN the nostalgia reminder loads THEN it SHALL show favorited entries that match today's date from previous years, consistent with the homepage throwback functionality
4. IF I have no favorited memories for the current date from previous years THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate "No favourited memories yet" message in both locations
5. WHEN favorited entries are displayed THEN they SHALL be properly formatted and accessible in both the homepage throwback and Digital Diary nostalgia reminder, showing only entries from the same date in past years
6. WHEN the throwback functionality is added to the homepage THEN it SHALL not break the existing nostalgia reminder functionality in the Digital Diary page
7. WHEN both throwback and nostalgia reminder features are active THEN they SHALL use the same data source and filtering logic to ensure consistency
### Requirement 3: Comprehensive Error Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer and user, I want all application errors to be resolved so that the app runs smoothly without crashes or unexpected behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I review all Dart files THEN there SHALL be no compilation errors in pages, services, utils, or widgets
2. WHEN the app runs THEN there SHALL be no runtime exceptions caused by code errors
3. WHEN services are called THEN they SHALL handle errors gracefully without crashing
4. WHEN widgets are rendered THEN they SHALL not throw rendering exceptions
5. WHEN utilities are used THEN they SHALL function correctly without errors
6. IF there are import issues THEN they SHALL be resolved with proper dependencies
7. WHEN error handling is implemented THEN it SHALL follow the established error handling patterns
8. WHEN Firebase operations fail THEN they SHALL be handled with appropriate user feedback
