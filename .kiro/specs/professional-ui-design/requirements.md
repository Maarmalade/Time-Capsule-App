# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a clean, classy, and professional UI design system for the Time Capsule Flutter application. The design will follow Material 3 principles with a modern, minimal aesthetic featuring a neutral color palette, professional typography, and spacious layouts. This comprehensive UI overhaul will enhance user experience through consistent visual design, improved readability, and a sophisticated appearance that reflects the app's purpose as a meaningful memory preservation platform.

5. WHEN showing interactive elements THEN the system SHALL implement Material 3 motion and animation guidelines for smooth transitions
6. WHEN rendering the interface THEN the system SHALL ensure accessibility compliance with Material 3 accessibility standards

### Requirement 2: Professional Color Palette and Theming

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to use a sophisticated neutral color palette with professional styling, so that the interface feels elegant and suitable for preserving meaningful memories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app displays THEN the system SHALL use a primary color palette of white (#FFFFFF), soft gray (#F5F5F7), and navy (#1A1A2E) as base colors
2. WHEN accent colors are needed THEN the system SHALL use a single, carefully chosen accent color (such as deep blue #2E5BFF or warm gold #D4AF37) sparingly for highlights and CTAs
3. WHEN displaying text THEN the system SHALL use high contrast ratios with dark navy (#1A1A2E) on light backgrounds and white on dark backgrounds
4. WHEN showing interactive states THEN the system SHALL use subtle color variations within the neutral palette for hover and pressed states
5. WHEN displaying status indicators THEN the system SHALL use muted versions of semantic colors (success: #28A745, warning: #FFC107, error: #DC3545)
6. WHEN theming components THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent color application across all UI elements and pages

### Requirement 3: Professional Typography System

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear, readable typography that enhances the professional appearance of the app, so that I can easily read and navigate content with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying text THEN the system SHALL use Google Fonts Inter or Roboto as the primary font family throughout the app
2. WHEN showing headings THEN the system SHALL implement a clear typographic hierarchy with consistent font weights (Light 300, Regular 400, Medium 500, SemiBold 600)
3. WHEN displaying body text THEN the system SHALL use appropriate font sizes (14-16px for body, 18-24px for headings) with proper line spacing (1.4-1.6 line height)
4. WHEN showing different content types THEN the system SHALL use consistent text styles for buttons, labels, captions, and body text
5. WHEN rendering text THEN the system SHALL ensure proper contrast ratios and readability across all screen sizes
6. WHEN displaying long-form content THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate paragraph spacing and text alignment for optimal reading experience

### Requirement 4: Modern Layout and Spacing System

**User Story:** As a user, I want spacious, well-organized layouts that don't feel cramped, so that I can focus on content without visual clutter or confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying content THEN the system SHALL use generous white space with consistent padding (16px, 24px, 32px) based on content hierarchy
2. WHEN showing lists or grids THEN the system SHALL implement proper spacing between items (12-16px gaps) for visual breathing room
3. WHEN displaying cards or containers THEN the system SHALL use consistent margins and internal padding following an 8px grid system
4. WHEN showing page layouts THEN the system SHALL implement proper content margins (24-32px from screen edges) on mobile and tablet devices
5. WHEN displaying navigation elements THEN the system SHALL provide adequate touch targets (minimum 44px) with proper spacing between interactive elements
6. WHEN organizing content THEN the system SHALL use clear visual grouping with appropriate section spacing and dividers

### Requirement 5: Refined Visual Elements and Components

**User Story:** As a user, I want polished visual elements with subtle shadows and rounded corners, so that the interface feels modern and sophisticated without being flashy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying cards and containers THEN the system SHALL use subtle rounded corners (8-12px border radius) for a soft, modern appearance
2. WHEN showing elevated elements THEN the system SHALL implement gentle shadows (elevation 2-4dp) that provide depth without being dramatic
3. WHEN displaying buttons THEN the system SHALL use appropriate elevation and rounded corners with subtle state transitions
4. WHEN showing input fields THEN the system SHALL use clean, minimal styling with subtle borders and focus states
5. WHEN displaying images and media THEN the system SHALL use consistent rounded corners and proper aspect ratios
6. WHEN showing dividers and separators THEN the system SHALL use subtle lines or spacing rather than harsh borders

### Requirement 6: Consistent Icon and Imagery System

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying icons THEN the system SHALL use Material Icons or a consistent icon family with uniform stroke width and style
2. WHEN showing navigation icons THEN the system SHALL use appropriate sizing (24px standard) with consistent visual weight
3. WHEN displaying user-generated images THEN the system SHALL apply consistent treatments (rounded corners, aspect ratios, placeholder states)
4. WHEN showing empty states THEN the system SHALL use subtle, professional illustrations or icons rather than cartoonish elements
5. WHEN displaying profile pictures THEN the system SHALL use circular cropping with consistent sizing and fallback avatars
6. WHEN showing media thumbnails THEN the system SHALL implement consistent aspect ratios and loading states

### Requirement 7: Professional Navigation and Information Architecture

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear, intuitive navigation that helps me understand where I am and how to get where I want to go, so that I can use the app efficiently and confidently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating the app THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual hierarchy with consistent navigation patterns
