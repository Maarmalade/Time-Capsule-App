# Scheduled Messages Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Status Not Updating After Delivery
**Problem**: Scheduled messages remained in "Pending" status even after successful delivery.

**Root Cause**: The `streamScheduledMessages` method only queried for pending messages, so delivered messages disappeared from the scheduled tab instead of showing as delivered.

**Solution**:
- Modified `streamScheduledMessages` to include both 'pending' and 'delivered' status messages
- Added proper sorting to show pending messages first, then delivered messages
- Implemented real-time streams for both scheduled and received messages

**Code Changes**:
```dart
// Before: Only pending messages
.where('status', isEqualTo: 'pending')

// After: Both pending and delivered messages
.where('status', whereIn: ['pending', 'delivered'])
```

### 2. ✅ UI Overflow Issue Fixed
**Problem**: RenderFlex overflow error with yellow and black striped pattern due to text being too long for available space.

**Root Cause**: Row widgets containing text without proper flex constraints were causing overflow.

**Solution**:
- Wrapped text widgets in `Expanded` or `Flexible` widgets
- Added `overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis` to prevent text overflow
- Restructured layout to use Column instead of Row for better space management
- Fixed all text elements that could potentially overflow

**Key Changes**:
```dart
// Before: Fixed width causing overflow
Text('To: ${recipient.username}')

// After: Flexible with ellipsis
Flexible(
  child: Text(
    'To: ${recipient.username}',
    overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis,
  ),
)
```

### 3. ✅ Clickable Images with Full-Screen View
**Problem**: Users couldn't click on images (like the Spider-Man image) to view them full-screen.

**Solution**:
- Created `FullScreenImageViewer` widget with InteractiveViewer for zoom/pan functionality
- Wrapped all image thumbnails with `GestureDetector` to handle tap events
- Added proper navigation to full-screen image viewer
- Implemented error handling and loading states for images

**New Features**:
```dart
Widget _buildImageThumbnail(String imageUrl, ThemeData theme) {
  return GestureDetector(
    onTap: () => _showFullScreenImage(imageUrl),
    child: Container(
      // Image container with proper styling
    ),
  );
}

void _showFullScreenImage(String imageUrl) {
  Navigator.of(context).push(
    MaterialPageRoute(
      builder: (context) => FullScreenImageViewer(imageUrl: imageUrl),
    ),
  );
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Status Updates**: Send a scheduled message and verify it shows as "Delivered" after delivery
2. **UI Overflow**: Test with long usernames and message content to ensure no overflow
3. **Image Interaction**: Click on images to verify full-screen viewing works
4. **Real-time Updates**: Keep the app open and verify messages update automatically when delivered
