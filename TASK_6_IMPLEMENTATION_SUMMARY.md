## Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 1.5: Consistent Status Display

### Requirement 3.1: Remove Unnecessary UI Elements
✅ Removed resume/play icon rectangles from scheduled messages main page

### Requirement 3.2: Clean Interface
✅ Simplified scheduled message items to show only relevant information: message preview, delivery time, status, and media attachments

## Technical Implementation Details

### Media Handling
- Uses `message.hasMedia()` to conditionally display media section
- Handles both `imageUrls` (List<String>?) and `videoUrl` (String?) from the model
- Implements proper error states and loading indicators
- Maintains consistent styling across all media types

### Status Management
- Utilizes existing `ScheduledMessageStatus` enum
- Implements helper methods for status-specific icons and text
- Handles edge cases like missing delivery timestamps
- Provides fallback behavior for unknown states

### UI/UX Improvements
- Maintains existing card layout and styling
- Adds media display without disrupting existing functionality
- Preserves all existing interactions (tap to view, cancel functionality)
- Ensures responsive design with proper spacing

## Testing
- Created comprehensive unit tests for both card widgets
- Tests cover media display, status handling, and edge cases
- Verified proper widget rendering and interaction handling
- Tests demonstrate correct behavior for all message states

## Code Quality
- Follows existing code patterns and conventions
- Maintains proper separation of concerns
- Uses consistent naming and documentation
- Implements proper error handling and edge case management

## Files Modified
- `lib/pages/scheduled_messages/scheduled_messages_page.dart`: Enhanced ScheduledMessageCard, ReceivedMessageCard, and MessageViewDialog classes

## Files Created
- `test/widgets/scheduled_message_card_test.dart`: Comprehensive test suite for the updated widgets

The implementation successfully addresses all requirements for task 6, providing a clean, consistent, and media-rich display for scheduled messages while removing unnecessary UI elements as specified.
