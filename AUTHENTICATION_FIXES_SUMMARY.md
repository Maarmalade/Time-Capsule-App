# Authentication and UI Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Yellow Bar Under Folder Content (UI Overflow)
**Problem**: Bottom sheet was causing overflow when adding content to folders
**Solution**: 
- Added `isScrollControlled: true` to showModalBottomSheet
- Added Container with maxHeight constraint (80% of screen height)
- Wrapped content in SingleChildScrollView
- Added bottom padding to prevent overflow

### 2. Permission Errors When Adding Contributors
**Problem**: Authentication state not properly verified before operations
**Solution**:
- Added `await currentUser.getIdToken(true)` to refresh and verify token
- Added proper FirebaseAuthException handling for token expiration
- Added ownership verification before allowing contributor invitations
- Enhanced error messages for authentication issues

**Problem**: Similar authentication verification issues
**Solution**:
- Added token verification in `respondToFriendRequest` method
- Enhanced error handling for authentication failures
