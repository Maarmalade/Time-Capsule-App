# Task 2 Implementation Summary: Media Upload Functionality in ScheduledMessageService

## Overview
Successfully implemented media upload functionality for scheduled messages, including support for multiple images and videos with comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms.

## Implemented Features

### 1. uploadMessageMedia() Method
- **Purpose**: Handles multiple image uploads to Firebase Storage
- **Features**:
  - Validates file types (images and videos only)
  - Validates file sizes using existing ValidationUtils
  - Implements retry mechanism with exponential backoff (up to 3 attempts)
  - Provides detailed error messages for each file
  - Generates unique storage paths using timestamp and user ID
  - Handles partial success scenarios (some uploads succeed, others fail)

### 2. createScheduledMessageWithMedia() Method
- **Purpose**: Creates scheduled messages with combined text, images, and video
- **Features**:
  - Accepts separate image and video file parameters
  - Uploads media files using uploadMessageMedia()
  - Categorizes uploaded URLs into images and videos based on file extensions
  - Integrates with existing createScheduledMessage() logic
  - Includes cleanup consideration for failed message creation

### 3. validateScheduledTime() Method
- **Purpose**: Improved time validation for scheduled messages
- **Features**:
  - Enforces minimum 1-minute future scheduling
  - Replaces previous validation logic
  - Provides clear validation rules for UI feedback

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
- **File Validation**: Uses existing ValidationUtils for comprehensive file validation
- **Upload Failures**: Implements retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- **Partial Failures**: Handles scenarios where some uploads succeed and others fail
- **Network Issues**: Graceful handling of network-related upload failures

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Type Support
- **Images**: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .webp
- **Videos**: .mp4, .mov, .avi, .mkv, .webm
- **Size Limits**: 10MB for images, 100MB for videos (from ValidationUtils)

### Storage Structure
```
scheduled_messages/{userId}/{timestamp}-{index}.{extension}
```

### Retry Mechanism
- Maximum 3 attempts per file
- Exponential backoff: 2s, 4s, 6s delays
- Individual file retry (one failed file doesn't stop others)

### URL Categorization Logic
```dart
// Separates uploaded URLs into images and videos
for (final url in uploadedUrls) {
  if (url.contains('.mp4') || url.contains('.mov') || /* other video extensions */) {
    videoUrl = url;
  } else {
    imageUrls.add(url);
  }
}
```

## Integration with Existing Code

### Dependencies Added
- `dart:io` for File handling
- `storage_service.dart` for Firebase Storage operations
- `validation_utils.dart` for file validation

### Model Compatibility
- Leverages existing `ScheduledMessage.imageUrls` field
- Uses existing `ScheduledMessage.videoUrl` field
- Compatible with existing `hasMedia()` and `getAllMediaUrls()` methods

### Service Integration
- Extends existing `ScheduledMessageService` constructor to accept `StorageService`
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing methods
- Integrates with existing rate limiting and validation logic

## Testing

### Unit Tests Created
- `scheduled_message_service_media_test.dart`: Tests core logic without Firebase dependencies
- `scheduled_message_service_integration_example.dart`: Demonstrates usage patterns

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Time validation logic (various scenarios)
- ✅ Media URL categorization
- ✅ File extension identification
- ✅ Error handling patterns
- ✅ Retry mechanism logic

## Requirements Fulfilled

### Requirement 1.1: Media Attachment Options
✅ System provides options to attach images or videos alongside text content

### Requirement 1.2: File Validation
✅ System validates file types and sizes before attachment with proper error messages

### Requirement 1.3: Firebase Storage Integration
✅ System stores media files in Firebase Storage with proper references

## Usage Example

```dart
final service = ScheduledMessageService();

// Create message with media
final message = ScheduledMessage(/* ... */);
final images = [File('image1.jpg'), File('image2.png')];
final video = File('video.mp4');

try {
  final messageId = await service.createScheduledMessageWithMedia(
    message,
    images,
    video,
  );
  print('Message created with ID: $messageId');
} catch (e) {
  print('Failed to create message: $e');
}
```

## Code Quality
- ✅ No lint warnings or errors
- ✅ Follows existing code patterns and conventions
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Proper documentation and comments
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility

## Next Steps
This implementation provides the foundation for:
1. UI components to select and display media (Task 5)
2. Enhanced message cards showing media previews (Task 6)
3. Integration with message creation pages (Task 7)

The media upload functionality is now ready for integration with the UI components in subsequent tasks.
