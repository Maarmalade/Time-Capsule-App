# Accessibility Implementation Guide

This document outlines the accessibility features implemented in the Time Capsule app and provides guidelines for maintaining and extending accessibility support.

## Overview

The Time Capsule app implements comprehensive accessibility features following WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines to ensure the app is usable by people with disabilities, including those who use screen readers, have motor impairments, or visual impairments.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Semantic Labels and Screen Reader Support

All interactive elements include proper semantic labels that provide meaningful descriptions for screen readers:

- **Buttons**: Include descriptive labels and hints about their function
- **Text Fields**: Have clear labels, hints, and validation messages
- **Images**: Include alt text or are properly excluded from the accessibility tree
- **Navigation**: Proper heading structure and navigation landmarks

### 2. WCAG AA Color Contrast Compliance

All color combinations in the design system meet or exceed WCAG AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 ratio):

- Primary text on backgrounds: ✓ Compliant
- Button text combinations: ✓ Compliant  
- Status indicators: ✓ Compliant
- Navigation elements: ✓ Compliant

### 3. Touch Target Requirements

All interactive elements meet the minimum 44x44dp touch target size requirement for accessibility.

### 4. Keyboard Navigation Support

The app supports keyboard navigation patterns for users who cannot use touch interfaces.

### 5. Focus Management

Proper focus management ensures users can navigate through the app logically using assistive technologies.

## Usage Examples

### Using Accessible Widgets

```dart
// Accessible Button
AccessibleButton(
  label: 'Save Memory',
  hint: 'Save the current memory to your album',
  onPressed: () => _saveMemory(),
)

// Accessible Text Field
AccessibleTextField(
  label: 'Memory Title',
  hint: 'Enter a title for your memory',
  required: true,
  controller: _titleController,
)

// Accessible Card
AccessibleCard(
  semanticLabel: 'Memory from vacation',
  hint: 'Tap to view full memory details',
  onTap: () => _viewMemory(),
  child: MemoryPreview(),
)
```

### Checking Color Contrast

```dart
// Validate design system colors
final results = ContrastChecker.validateDesignSystemContrast();
final report = ContrastChecker.generateContrastReport();
print(report);

// Check specific color combination
final result = ContrastChecker.checkContrast(
  'Custom combination',
  Colors.blue,
  Colors.white,
);
print('Meets WCAG AA: ${result.meetsWCAGAA}');
```

### Creating Semantic Labels

```dart
// Create comprehensive semantic label
final label = AccessibilityUtils.createSemanticLabel(
  label: 'Settings',
  hint: 'Open app settings',
  isButton: true,
  isSelected: false,
);

// Create accessibility hint
final hint = AccessibilityUtils.createAccessibilityHint(
  action: 'Double tap',
  result: 'open memory details',
  navigation: 'memory detail page',
);
```

## Testing Accessibility

### Running Accessibility Tests

```bash
# Run all accessibility tests
flutter test test/accessibility/

# Run specific test suites
flutter test test/accessibility/accessibility_utils_test.dart
flutter test test/accessibility/contrast_checker_test.dart
flutter test test/accessibility/user_flow_accessibility_test.dart
```

### Using Test Utilities

```dart
testWidgets('should be accessible', (tester) async {
  await tester.pumpWidget(MyWidget());
  
  // Run comprehensive accessibility audit
  tester.auditAccessibility();
  
  // Generate accessibility report
  final report = tester.getAccessibilityReport();
  print(report);
  
  // Verify specific aspects
  tester.verifyTouchTargets();
  tester.verifySemanticLabels();
});
```

### Manual Testing with Screen Readers

#### iOS VoiceOver Testing
1. Enable VoiceOver in Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOver
2. Navigate through the app using swipe gestures
3. Verify all elements are announced correctly
4. Test form submission and error handling

#### Android TalkBack Testing
1. Enable TalkBack in Settings > Accessibility > TalkBack
2. Use explore by touch to navigate
3. Verify semantic labels and hints are clear
4. Test navigation between screens

## Best Practices

### 1. Semantic Labels
- Use clear, descriptive labels that explain the element's purpose
- Include context when necessary (e.g., "Delete photo" not just "Delete")
- Avoid redundant information (don't say "button" if it's already marked as a button)

### 2. Form Accessibility
- Always provide labels for form fields
- Use hint text for additional guidance
- Ensure error messages are clearly associated with fields
- Mark required fields appropriately

### 3. Navigation
- Provide clear heading structure (h1, h2, h3)
- Use landmarks to identify page sections
- Ensure focus moves logically through the interface
- Provide skip links for long navigation lists

### 4. Images and Media
- Provide meaningful alt text for informative images
- Mark decorative images as such (exclude from accessibility tree)
- Provide captions or transcripts for video content
- Ensure media controls are accessible

### 5. Color and Contrast
- Never rely on color alone to convey information
- Ensure sufficient contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- Test with color blindness simulators
- Provide alternative indicators (icons, patterns) alongside color

## Accessibility Checklist

### Before Release
- [ ] All interactive elements have semantic labels
